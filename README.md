Welcome to the Guide on Creating the BWSI 2018 Discord Channel
==============================================================

### Step 1: Setting up your account

Simply go to https://discordapp.com/register to create an account, or login if you alread have one. All members and instructors will have to own an account to participate in the channel. It is suggested that they authenticate their account with their email, to protect themselves, and the channels they are in.

You can install the discord client, which runs on all mobile and desktop operating systems (including Linux!), but the in-browser client works just as well :) 

### Step 2: Send me a friend request!

We will be able to comminicate faster as friends using Discord, and we will be able to PM and Voice chat during the setup process. However, this step is completely optional.

### Step 3: Create the channel

This step is also optional, as I already have a channel running as an example, but it can be used as the primary channel, it is fully functional. Creating a new channel with all the features needed took about an hour, but it is up to you if you want to start from scratch.

If you do, follow the next few steps. If not, skip to the last step!

### Step 4: Create Roles for each group

It is suggested to have a role for each group of students, so that we can be organized, and everyone can be easily identified. Each role has specific permissions, and will show up on eveyones screen in a seperate color. For example, all of the Instructors will be blue, and have the ability to filter messages and manage the channel, while all Medalytics students might be red, and only have the ability to text in a few selected channels - these are not the actual colors/permissions, which will be brought up in...

### Step 5: Permissions
