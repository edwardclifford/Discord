# Creating the BWSI 2018 Discord Server
=======================================


## Key Words
**Channel** - Refers to the server as a whole

**Room** - A specific chat room

**Role** - A set of rules regarding permissions that is helpful when categorizing users

### Step 1: Setting up your account

Simply go to https://discordapp.com/register to create an account, or login if you alread have one. All members and instructors will have to own an account to participate in the channel. It is suggested that they authenticate their account with their email, to protect themselves, and the channels they are in.

You can install the discord client, which runs on all mobile and desktop operating systems (including Linux!), but the in-browser client works just as well :) 

### Step 2: Send me a friend request!

We will be able to comminicate faster as friends using Discord, and we will be able to PM and Voice chat during the setup process. However, this step is completely optional.

### Step 3: Create the channel

This step is also optional, as I already have created a fully functional channel as an example, but it can be used as the primary channel. Creating a new channel with all the features needed took about an hour, but it is up to you if you want to start from scratch. I have sent you the channel link in the email.

If you do want to create your own channel, follow the next steps. If not, skip to **Step 8**!

### Step 4: Create Roles for each group

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/roles.PNG)

It is suggested to have a role for each group of students, so that we can be organized, and everyone can be easily identified. Each role has specific permissions, and will show up on eveyones screen in a seperate color. For example, all of the Instructors will be blue, and have the ability to filter messages and manage the channel, while all Medalytics students might be red, and only have the ability to text in a few selected channels - these are not the actual colors/permissions, which will be brought up in...

### Step 5: Permissions

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/permisions.PNG)

You can individually tweak each role to have certain permissions. I set up the example discord like follows: *if we want to use the channel I made, these roles can be easily edited and added to*

  **Administrator:** Holds all permisions, is ruler of the channel, and controls all lower roles (i.e. You)
  
  **Instructors:** Is a designation, meaning these peoples names will show up in blue. They have the same permisions, but obviously can't remove you from power.
  
  **Moderators:** They have less power than instructors, but can still remove messages and users that are acting inapporprietly. This is where I will hang out, at least to start.
  
  **Students:** This permission spans 10 different roles, but the only difference is the color and title of the role. No one group has power over the others
  
  **Base permissions (i.e. everyone that joins):** They will only have permission to request status as a member or student. This prevents random and unverified people from joining the chat and mucking up the place (This is rare as only Admins and Moderators can invite people to the channel)

### Step 6: Creating rooms

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/categories.PNG)

This is where the meat of the channel comes into focus. Most large channels seperate their chat rooms into different categories. In the example I sent you, I created 4 types of categories: **Information**, **General**, **Specified**, and **Administration**.

The first and the last of those channels can (for the most part) only be accessed or contributed to by specific members. The **Information** category is for the Welcome channel, which the members will first see when they join, and Announcements channel, where members can go to see posts from instructors. This is sort of like a pin board for the channel. 

The **General** category contains text rooms and a voice rooms for more general interactions, like making friends and contacts between different programs. The **Specified** categories are more for focused groups of students belonging to the same program to communicate. It can be set that only students withing that program can see and interact with those rooms (though this *could* lead to exclusion, it would also lead to a nicer user experience as they would not need to deal with the clutter of other rooms). 

Rooms can be easily added and removed, and user input would be appreciated on what and how many rooms are needed. I only added a few for each section in my example.

### Step 7: Welcome message

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/welcome.PNG)

Create a welcome message in a section of the channel that only Admins can contribute. This will explain to users how to get their roles and how to report inappropriate behavior. I typed out a quick message as an example in the picture above.

### Step 8: Inviting members:

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/invite.PNG)

Now it is time to invite everyone! I suggest that we invite the Instuctors first (or at least a few of them) and get them situated with their roles and how to moderate. Then, we could have Ms. Kelley send a mass email with the share code (which students only need to click on, then create an account, to join) or post it on Piazza (or both!). Once everyone starts rolling in, we can start...

### Step 9: Assigning roles:

![creating channel](https://github.com/edwardclifford/Discord/blob/master/role%20assignment.PNG)

Students can request roles in a special channel that will prevent spam, and allow moderators to verify that they are actually students. As stated in the Welcome message, I created a Member role to provide an option to students that did not necessarily get accepted, but want to continue to work with us.

### Conclusion:

Thank you for letting me help with this project! I am excited to get to know everyone using the Discord! Like I said earlier, I am perfectly fine helping you set up a new channel, but I believe the example one I created has everything we need for an enjoyable experience for all!
